# Uber_Data_analysis
## This dataset contains around 560,000 raw data. It is the Uber data manily from New York city. The dataset consists of four kinds of variable, Date/Time, order-longitude, order-latitude, and the cars' base.
### I use Python along with the data analytics packages Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn on this project. I want to see weather the Date/Time has the positive or negative realationship to the frequence of orders, and the relationship between longitude/latitude and frequence of orders.
